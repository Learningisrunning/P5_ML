Confusion about virtual/new/override,"<p>I am a bit confused about the <code>virtual</code>/<code>new</code>/<code>override</code> thing. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
    public virtual void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""A::mVVirtual""); }
}

class B : A
{
    public virtual void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""B::mVVirtual""); }
}

class C : B
{
    public override void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""C::mVVirtual""); }
}


class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b1 = new C();
        b1.mVVirtual();    //C::mVVirtual ... I understand this

        A a2 = new C();
        a2.mVVirtual();    //A::mVVirtual ... ???
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't get why in the second call we get <code>A::mVVirtual</code>. I usually treat these issues with this ""algorithm"":</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the type of the variable holding the reference for the object for an instance method called <code>mVVirtual</code>? Doesn't have one...but does have a virtual method with that signature and name!</li>
<li>Virtual method? Let's then check the type of the object being held by <code>a2</code> (<code>C</code>) for an overriding of that method. It has one -> Executes <code>C::mVVirtual</code>!</li>
</ol>

<p>Where is my ""algorithm"" wrong? I really am confused by this, and would greatly appreciate some help.</p>

Rules engine for spatial and temporal reasoning?,"<p>I have an application that receives a number of datums that characterize 3 dimensional spatial and temporal processes.

CruiseControl.rb PATH,"<p>I'm trying to get CruiseControl.rb to run rcov during a build. It's currently failing with the following error:</p>

<p>Since I can run <code>rcov</code> from the shell when I log in, I figure that this is a PATH problem. (Additionally, I can run both <code>rake test:rcov</code> and <code>rake cruise</code> from the shell without errors). I added a <code>p 'echo $PATH'</code> statement (with the correct backticks to execute the command; thanks Markdown) to my cruise.rake and discovered that the path was indeed incorrect:</p>

x86 opcode alignment references and guidelines,"<p>I'm generating some opcodes dynamically in a JIT compiler and I'm looking for guidelines for opcode alignment.</p>

<p>1) I've read comments that briefly ""recommend"" alignment by adding nops after calls</p>

<p>2) I've also read about using nop for optimizing sequences for parallelism.</p>

<p>3) I've read that alignment of ops is good for ""cache"" performance</p>

<p>Usually these comments don't give any supporting references. Its one thing to read a blog or a comment that says, ""its a good idea to do such and such"", but its another to actually write a compiler that implements specific op sequences and realize most material online, especially blogs, are not useful for practical application. So I'm a believer in finding things out myself (disassembly, etc. to see what real world apps do). This is one case where I need some outside info.</p>

<p>I notice compilers will usually start an odd byte instruction immediately after whatever previous instruction sequence there was. So the compiler is not taking any special care in most cases. I see ""nop"" here or there, but usually it seems nop is used sparingly, if at all. How critical is opcode alignment? Can you provide references for cases that I can actually use for implementation?

"Misuse of the CSS class attribute, or valid design pattern?","<p>As you most likely already know, it's simple in JQuery to select all elements in the document that have a specific CSS class, and then, using chaining, assign common event handlers to the selected elements:</p>

<pre><code>$("".toolWindow"").click(toolWindow_click);
$("".toolWindow"").keypress(toolWindow_keypress);
</code></pre>

<p>As usual the class ""toolWindow"" is also normally defined in CSS and associated with some visual styles:</p>

<pre><code>.toolWindow{
   color:blue;
   background-color:white;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class attribute is now responsible for indicating not just the appearance (visual state) of the element, but also the behaviour.  As a result, I quite often use this approach and define CSS class names more as pseudo object oriented classes then visual only CSS classes.  In other words, each class represents both state (CSS styles) and behaviour (events).  </p>

<p>In some cases I have even created classes with no visual styling and simply use them as a convenient way to assign behaviour to elements.  </p>

<p>Moreover, the jQuery LiveQuery plugin (and the live() built-in function) make this approach even more effective by automatically binding events to dynamically created elements belonging to a specificed class.</p>

<p>Of late I am primarily using class names as defining a common set of behaviour for associated DOM elements and only later using them to define a visual style. </p>

<p>Questions:  Is this a terrible misuse of the CSS ""class"" attribute, if so why?  </p>

<p>On the other hand, perhaps it is a perfectly valid approach to further implementing ""separate of concerns"" and improving the maintainability of HTML/DHTML pages? </p>

Spawning multiple SQL tasks in SQL Server 2005,"<p>I have a number of stored procs which I would like to all run simultaneously on the server.  Ideally all on the server without reliance on connections to an external client.</p>

<p>What options are there to launch all these and have them run simultaneously (I don't even need to wait until all the processes are done to do additional work)?</p>

<p>I have thought of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Launching multiple connections from
a client, having each start the
appropriate SP.</li>
<li>Setting up jobs for
each SP and starting the jobs from a
SQL Server connection or SP.</li>
<li>Using
xp_cmdshell to start additional runs
equivalent to osql or whetever</li>
<li>SSIS - I need to see if the package can be dynamically written to handle more SPs, because I'm not sure how much access my clients are going to get to production</li>
</ul>

<p>In the job and cmdshell cases, I'm probably going to run into permissions level problems from the DBA...</p>

<p>SSIS could be a good option - if I can table-drive the SP list.</p>

<p>This is a datawarehouse situation, and the work is largely independent and NOLOCK is universally used on the stars.  The system is an 8-way 32GB machine, so I'm going to load it down and scale it back if I see problems.</p>

<p>I basically have three layers, Layer 1 has a small number of processes and depends on basically all the facts/dimensions already being loaded (effective, the stars are a Layer 0 - and yes, unfortunately they will all need to be loaded), Layer 2 has a number of processes which depend on some or all of Layer 1, and Layer 3 has a number of processes which depend on some or all of Layer 2.  I have the dependencies in a table already, and would only initially launch all the procs in a particular layer at the same time, since they are orthogonal within a layer.</p>

Sync without scanning individual files?,"<p>Consider two directories:</p>

<pre>
/home/user/music/flac

<p>I would like the second directory (destination; a USB drive) to contain the same files and structure as the first directory (master). There are 3600+ files (59G in total). Every file is scanned using <a href=""http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">unison</a>, which is painfully slow. I would rather it compare based on file name, size, and modification time.</p>

WPF Animation - Animating Bezier curve points,"<p>I'm working on a project that involves drawing curved paths between two objects.  Currently, I've been writing some test code to play around with bezier curves and animation.  The first test is simply to move the endpoint (Point3) from the origin object (a rectangle) to the destination object (another rectangle), in a straight line.  here is the code which sets up the actual line:</p>

<pre><code>        connector = new Path();
        connector.Stroke = Brushes.Red;
        connector.StrokeThickness = 3;

        PathGeometry connectorGeometry = new PathGeometry();
        PathFigure connectorPoints = new PathFigure();
        connectorCurve = new BezierSegment();

        connectorPoints.StartPoint = new Point((double)_rect1.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect1.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect1.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect1.Height / 2);
        connectorCurve.Point1 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;
        connectorCurve.Point2 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;
        connectorCurve.Point3 = connectorPoints.StartPoint;

        connectorPoints.Segments.Add(connectorCurve);
        connectorGeometry.Figures.Add(connectorPoints);
        connector.Data = connectorGeometry;
        MainCanvas.Children.Add(connector);
</code></pre>

<p>OK, so we now have a line collapsed to a point.  Now, lets animate that line, going from _rect1 to _rect2 (the two objects at the endpoints):</p>

<pre><code>        PointAnimation pointAnim = new PointAnimation();
        pointAnim.From = connectorCurve.Point3;
        pointAnim.To = new Point((double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect2.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect2.Height / 2);
        pointAnim.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));
        board.Children.Add(pointAnim);
</code></pre>

<p>Works beautifully.  However, when I try to do it with a storyboard, I get nothing.  Here's the storyboarded code:</p>

<pre><code>        Storyboard board = new Storyboard();
        PointAnimation pointAnim = new PointAnimation();
        pointAnim.From = connectorCurve.Point3;
        pointAnim.To = new Point((double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty) + _rect2.Width / 2,
            (double)_rect2.GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty) + _rect2.Height / 2);
        pointAnim.Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5));

        Storyboard.SetTarget(pointAnim, connectorCurve);
        Storyboard.SetTargetProperty(pointAnim, new PropertyPath(BezierSegment.Point3Property));
        board.Children.Add(pointAnim);
        board.Begin();
</code></pre>

"Why is using a certificate, made with the MakeCert tool, in production bad?","<p>I'm currently working on a project where I've created a CA cert and a couple of child certs to that CA cert. The certificates are going to be used to protect inter-server communication in a SAMLV2 setup so I'm going to have a cert for the identity provider and a cert for the service provider.

Of course I realize that if I lose control of my root cert anyone could start creating all sorts of certificates.

Only then could they start to generate fake saml requests and responses to my applications.</p>

How do I change the permissions that MySQL uses to create database directories and files?,"<p>I have a self-installed MySQL service running on my OS X Snow Leopard machine, compiled using the automated installer from mysql.com.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is that I want to sync my database files, from the ""data"" directory, using Dropbox. All directories and files created within that folder are being assigned to the user ""_mysql"" and group ""wheel"", with the permission of 700. This permission is leaving the files effectively locked, with a red ""no entry"" icon overlay, and not allowing Dropbox, or me, access to them.</p>

<p>As a temporary measure I can manually change the file permissions to 755 to give me the required access. However, any new database files created by MySQL will still be given the default permission value of 700. Not ideal.</p>

<p>What I need to do is either change the user/group that MySQL uses to creates these files or change the default permissions value to something that will allow other users/groups to at least read the database files.</p>

Can I avoid having an UpdatePanel that kills viewstate?,"<p>I selection page that has a gridview that presents the user with a list of data items that they can click on to ""drill into"" - redirecting them to the data maintenance page.</p>

<p>Because the list can get long, we have a series of check boxes and drop-down lists at the top that act as filters.</p>

<p>We just implemented an UpdatePanel with an UpdatePanelAnimationExtender so that when the page made long trips back to the databse, they would get a nice ""Processing..."" pop up.</p>

<p>Problem is, this seems to break the viewstate on the drop-down lists and check boxes.  Now, when they go to the 'detail page' and hit the BACK button to get back to the 'selection' page - the selected values in the checkboxes and drop-downlists are back to their initial defaults.  The lists are still populated, but they 'forgot' what they had when the user clicked to the data maintenance page.</p>

<p>I took out the .aspx code for the UpdatePanel and the animation extended and retested and everything worked perfectly.  So, apparently, the UpdatePanel and/or the AnimationExtender doesn't play nice with the viewstate.</p>

Best way to store and retrieve this..?,"<p>I've been trying all night, and talk of maps, arrays, vectors and hash_maps have filled my head. im just confused now. i posted a previous question here: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1687085/c-map-really-slow"">C++ map really slow?</a></p>

<p>problem was fixed but it seems map's are still not fast enough. i need to keep adding data. data is added ALOT during run time. i got it all working now, and if i add 1 piece of data per step (per frame in the game) it works fine. but once i do 2 at a time, i see performance drops. i looked into this hash stuff but couldn't find alot on it. just an fyi, the number of items stores will probably never exceed 2000~ or so. so i guess it is fairly small scaled..</p>

<p>what im trying to store, as someone else put it, is this:
""object with id 101 has a value of 4 for setting 1"" or information[101][1] = 4;
except that i just keep getting more and more objects (differet id's, which is the key value) added into the system with different settings (2nd key). - i dont know what the size of the array will be (thats why i didnt use arrays). looked into vectors but that confused the hell out of me. >_&lt;</p>

<p>right now i have:</p>

<pre><code>//declared as a class member
map&lt;double,  map&lt;int, double&gt; &gt; objIdMap;

//// lower down the page, in some function
map&lt;int, double&gt; objSettingsMap;
objSettingsMap[0] = value;
objSettingsMap[1] = value;
objSettingsMap[2] = value;
objSettingsMap[3] = value;
objIdMap[id] = objSettingsMap;
return(1);
</code></pre>

<p>or maybe it isnt the map's? is it normal for maps to perform slow like this when they're used so heavily? (i havnt included it in the code above, but on every step of the game every object with an id in objIdMap is accessing it to retrieve their objSettingsMap values. though the slow downs only occur when the above is executed more than once per step)..</p>

<p>so yea, what do you guys think is the best way to hold this data, and retrieve it etc? please provide example :( thanks</p>

Rollback and Preview in a CMS,"<p>I am creating a CMS and am using serialize to handle publish and rollback, which seems to work fine.  Basically, The normal site tables are what gets displayed and anything not displayed is serialized in a separate table.  The problem however is in making the 'Preview' functions work.  </p>

<p>Since the front end is created using normal SQL calls, and all the pre-published/rolled back data is in a separate table it would mean updating every sql statement with some fancy code to pull the version correct to the preview.  It will also get especially problematic with things like limits etc and would be a nightmare for the front end.</p>

<p>The only other approach I can see is a separate database/table(s) for the preview copy, but many people may be using the preview function and I am loathe to create a duplicate database for every person using preview as it will very quickly get out of hand.</p>

<p>Is there any way of doing this that will allow preview, and rollback preview, but will not require much from the code that displays the contents of the database and also avoid the problem of mass duplication?</p>
