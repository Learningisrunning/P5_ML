Confusion about virtual/new/override,"<p>I am a bit confused about the <code>virtual</code>/<code>new</code>/<code>override</code> thing. Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>class A
{
    public virtual void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""A::mVVirtual""); }
}

class B : A
{
    public virtual void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""B::mVVirtual""); }
}

class C : B
{
    public override void mVVirtual() { Console.WriteLine(""C::mVVirtual""); }
}


class Test
{
    static void Main()
    {
        B b1 = new C();
        b1.mVVirtual();    //C::mVVirtual ... I understand this

        A a2 = new C();
        a2.mVVirtual();    //A::mVVirtual ... ???
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't get why in the second call we get <code>A::mVVirtual</code>. I usually treat these issues with this ""algorithm"":</p>

<ol>
<li>Check the type of the variable holding the reference for the object for an instance method called <code>mVVirtual</code>? Doesn't have one...but does have a virtual method with that signature and name!</li>
<li>Virtual method? Let's then check the type of the object being held by <code>a2</code> (<code>C</code>) for an overriding of that method. It has one -> Executes <code>C::mVVirtual</code>!</li>
</ol>

<p>Where is my ""algorithm"" wrong? I really am confused by this, and would greatly appreciate some help.</p>

RoR on GAE?,"<p>Since Google App Engine will soon full support <a href=""http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2009/04/seriously-this-time-new-language-on-app.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Java</a>: </p>

<p>Would it be possible to run Ruby on Rails on Google App Engine? Or the limitations imposed by the AppEngine runtime will affect the JRuby implementation?</p>

<p>What about other languages such as Groovy, Clojure, Scheme?</p>

<p>Are there any effort to support .net and C# in JVM?? I think this would create a NEXT level on webdevelopment.</p>
